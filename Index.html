         <p>Car pooling is something we are all subject too. Therefore, it is more likely than you think that a neighbour of yours be going to the same area of work as you. Since we unfortunately go to work on a daily basis, you can find out easily if you can find a perfect match.</p>

        <h2> Power of a community</h2>
         <p> Have you thought about the fact that if everyone was car pooling in the morning? We built an algorithm that will enable to predict how important it is for people to carpool on a given day, in order to reduce traffic congestion. Let's reduce traffic congestion together. </p>
